# Pillar ![](https://github.com/syropian/pillar/workflows/run-tests/badge.svg?branch=main)

An opinionated skeleton for building apps with Laravel, Hybridly, Vue, and Tailwind.

## Features

❯ 🚀 Smooth client-server communication with [Hybridly](https://hybridly.dev/).

❯ 🔐 Authentication and registration built-in, including a password reset flow.

❯ ⚡ Lightning quick HMR and bundling with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

❯ 🦺 End-to-end type safety with TypeScript, `spatie/laravel-data` and `spatie/laravel-typescript-transformer`.

❯ 🎨 Utility-first styling with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

❯ 🧹 Linting and formatting with ESLint and Prettier.

❯ 🧪 Tests with [Pest](https://pestphp.com/).

## Why Pillar?

I built Pillar mostly for myself, so I can quickly spin up new projects without having to set up the same boilerplate-y things each and every time. This allows me to focus on the actual business logic of whatever application I'm building right out of the gates.

## Can you add _x_, _y_, or _z_?

Probably not, unless I need it.
